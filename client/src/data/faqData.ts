  {
    question: 'How do solar panels work?',
    answer: 'Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use solar energy at night?',
    answer: 'Solar panels do not generate power at night, but a battery system or grid connection provides power.',
  },
    {
    question: 'How much can I save with solar panels?',
    answer:
      'Savings depend on your location, energy usage, and system size, but most customers see a significant reduction in their electricity bills.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do solar panels work on cloudy days?',
    answer:
      'Yes! Solar panels still produce energy on cloudy days, though at a reduced rate compared to sunny days.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the installation process like?',
    answer:
      'We start with a consultation and site assessment, design a custom system, Free Quote, handle permitting, equipment, Interconnection  paperwork and approvals to connect your system to the gridand, schedule a professional installation and support.',

  {
    question: 'What qualifications do your solar installers have?',
    answer: 'All our installers are vetted and certified to meet local, state, and national solar installation standards.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you select installer partners?',
    answer: 'We interview, verify licenses, check insurance, and ensure compliance with industry regulations before partnering.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are installer partners insured?',
    answer: 'Yes, all partners carry general liability insurance and workers’ compensation, verified before onboarding.',
  },

export const designFaqs = [
  {
    question: 'What factors are considered in a custom solar design?',
    answer: 'We evaluate your roof angle, shading, energy consumption, and available space to create the most efficient layout.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a battery with my solar system?',
    answer: 'Not necessarily. Grid-tied systems work without batteries, though storage helps during outages or peak hours.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does the design process take?',
    answer: 'Typically 3–5 business days after site assessment and reviewing your utility usage.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can my solar system be expanded later?',
    answer: 'Yes. We design with future expansion in mind if you plan to add more panels or electric vehicles.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who signs off on the final system design?',
    answer: 'A NABCEP-certified engineer reviews and approves every system design before permitting.',

export const SolarIncentivesFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What is the Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)?",
    answer:
      "The Federal Solar Tax Credit allows you to deduct 30% of the cost of installing a solar energy system from your federal taxes. It's available for both residential and commercial systems installed before 2032.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any local or state incentives for solar panels?",
    answer:
      "Yes, many states and municipalities offer additional incentives like rebates, performance-based incentives (PBIs), and property tax exemptions. Check your local government or utility provider for details.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine multiple solar incentives?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You can combine the Federal ITC with state and local incentives, as well as net metering programs, to maximize your savings and reduce your system’s payback time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do solar incentives apply to battery storage systems?",
    answer:
      "Yes, battery systems paired with solar panels are eligible for the Federal Tax Credit if installed at the same time. Some states also offer incentives for standalone battery storage.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I claim the solar tax credit on my taxes?",
    answer:
      "To claim the Federal Solar Tax Credit, you must file IRS Form 5695 with your tax return. It's recommended to consult a tax professional to ensure proper documentation and compliance.",
